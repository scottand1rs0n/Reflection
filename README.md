Today, I learned how to work my rasberry pi. We worked on connecting the internet to the pi, as well as how to clone files. I also learned a few types of commands like ls and ping! I learned that with pi, you don't need to download any files or programs because they are all downloaded. I am hoping to learn how to further navigate the pi and create programs that can be used in my everday life. I am very happy with the course so far, and am learning a lot. Overall, I learned how to do a few bacic commands, how to clone, and how to work together and find a solution to difficult problems like setting up the wifi. Can't wait till we start getting serious and making some crazy programs that can make life easier.
