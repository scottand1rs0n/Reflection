This summer, I learned so much in so little time. First, I learned about how a computer thinks. A computer uses 1's and 0's to do operations, also known as binary. The computer uses circuts to turn switches on and off. The parts of a computer include the hard drive, CPU, as well as the motherboard. Although these are not the only parts, the computer has thousands of pieces that all work together. When we started coding, I was using the pi. I thought the terminal in the pi was where you coded, and I thought I was in the matrix. I had expirence with alice, but when I saw real code I was overwhelmed. I enjoyed working on the website using html and css. I liked how we could customize the site and make it our own. When I got my laptop, I installed python and began learning about python code. We started with bacic code like printing "Hello". We then started doing more complex code. I learned so much and will continue coding in the future!

Today, I spent my time working on happy numbers. I started off by doing a simple program that squares a number. I then began working on the other parts of the project, such as spliting the number up into digits and squaring them. This is where I am stuck. I wrote the requirements out to help me understand it better. Now, I need to get each function to work. Split function is supposed to split up the number that you enter, so that the square function can double each of the numbers. I then need to add the numbers up, and continue the process until the answer is 0. This is a tough problem, but I am going to work on it later tonight and tomorrow. I also need to do some more work on my twitter bot. As of now, I am more focused on the happy numbers project.

Today, I learned more about defining variables, as well as how to use math to solve problems. I came into class today not knowing how to use variables, and I am leaving with more knowledge than I came in with! I now know how defining functions work, why they are useful, and how to make my own variables. It took a while to figure it out, but after doing it with some math it now makes sence. It is so much easier to use defining variables than using block code. I will learn how to do more with the twitter project, and I am thinking of new ways to gain followers. I am learning so much from running into problems.

Today, I set up a fake email, phone number, and twitter. We did this the first half of class. The second half consisted of pimping out the twitter acount. I found cool pics to make it look legit, and added a nice bio for and added touch. I also posted 2 tweets, one a test and one a personal tweet. I am very interested in this topic because it it fun, complicated, and something that has an influence on the real world. Coding bacic programs was fun, but now we are moving into more complex code. I still need to start the happy numbers project. I am planning on working on it tonight, as well as doing research on the twitter project. For the last week, I am going to give it my all, and learn everything I can before I leave. I have already learned so much in the past 4 weeks. I would have never been able to do this at home, and I believe this class is the best way to get into coding. So far, we learned about functions, variables, loops, if statements, etc. I will continue coding when this class is over.

Today, I worked on the coding project. I had the base code down, but there were a few errors with it. Eventually, I fixed it and moved on to other issues. I would try something for a while, but when it would not work, I would start trying random things to see if it would work. We then got the isssue down to just one small problem. I apparently had the right code at the start of the project, but one small issue that was hiding so well made me think the problem was with the thing I had right. I fixed that problem, and the code worked. However, it still does not find the password. We will fix that tomorrow. Overall, I learned that I need to look at the big picture, then zoom into smaller details. I would try small issues hoping it would work out, and find out that it did not work. I also learned from Mr. Gold what to look for and how to fix it. Small details like these will help me with my next project. I learned a lot today, and I am happy nobody told me how to do it. Mr. Gold would give me help and tips when I was struggling, 
but never told me directly what to do or what was wrong. I learned a lot from this.

Today, I worked on the wifi project which is still unfinished. I tried adding other and's and or's, as well as fixing the layout. I believe the issue is in the and statements, even though there are many places it could go wrong. I want to figure the code out and break through this barrier, so that I can move on to different projects. When the problem is tough, I start trying random things. After a while, it becomes mindless. I will keep working on it tomorrow. I also learned from the coding website. I learned how to count the number of letters in a string, and how to fully capitalize a string or completely lowercase it. I have to re-do the website because I did not make an account on the website. I learned a lot today, but still did not finish the wifi project.

I learned about factorials, and refreshed on if and and/or statements. I worked on the wifi project for the majority of the class, and am asking many questions. Currently, I am working on the if statements that check for ones and zeros. I am working very hard on this project, and I am learning so much about code. I am learning the wifi code, and how to think like a programmer. I am planning on researching more into how to use python. The more frustrated I get, the more I want to figure it out. I am getting more and more intrested in making my own code the way I think. I want my code to be unique to how I think and how my brain puts together information. Can't wait till I figure out the wifi project.

Today, I learned how to properly do the box and dot code. My code was incorrect in the end. I was trying to get the hoizontal dots to show up, but it only worked with 2 across. I was trying to multiply rather than use loops. I was trying to do print((x) * (y)) to get it to go down and right, but this does not work. I also learned about password crackers. I tried finding the password to the classword wifi, and worked very long. I was about to shut it down, and at one point was doing it wrong. I then tried password. The password was password, the most common password used. I tried this before in a list, but since I was doing it wrong, it would have never worked. I tried hard today, and learned that coding always gets harder. There is no easy way to do it, I just have to keep trying different ways. I have to look at the big picture and try to find a way to make it work in order.

Today, I learned about loops. A loop makes a function run until a code tells it to stop. We did a few practice programs that invoved repeating numbers, then started the dot project. I was so close to finishing the project, but time ran out and I needed to write the reflection. My problem was in the print statement in the last line of code. This was my issue with the clock project too. I was one piece away from finishing, and I could not figure out what was wrong. With this project, I need to figure out how to get the x value because it goes down but not right. I tried multiplying, adding, and many other ways, but ended up with the same problem. I am hoping to figure this out soon. I believe that multiplying the y by 2 or squaring it to make it stretch to whatever the y is.

Today, I learned about if and else statements, as well as string manipulation. I applied what I learned to a clock project. First, we made the clock work by using strings and if/else statements. After testing/fixing the code, it displayed the first and second numbers. Then, we took it a step further and converted military time to normal time for times in the morning and evening. Now, I need to convert standard time to military time. Instead of subtracting 12, I will add 12 and remove the am/pm. For example, 10:30 PM in military time would be 22:30. We get this by adding 12 to the first time. I learned so much today, and am very happy we did such a tough project. I learned how to think through a problem in code, and how to fully understand what the requirements are.

Today, we reviewed lists, and learned about dictionaries. We used the two in a coding example where we needed to use variables and dictionaries to allow the code to work. I leanred more about Atom and how it works, as well as how to link python to Atom. I remember what code to enter into python, but with the new feature I don't need to use it anymore! I continued working on my pokemon project as well, and coded the bacic format. I will go back and add more features like text scrolling and possibly even pictures! I learned how to combine strings as well, which helped with the last line of code. I am getting much more comfortable with the code, and I am learning lots. Today was a huge success!

Today, I worked on setting up my laptop for the project we are starting. I installed Python on my laptop, as well as Atom and Git desktop. I tried searching through the programs to get comfortable with how they work. I am struggling with this, but tonight I am going to play around with the programs. I am also struggling with figuring out the code for the Pokemon project. We are using print and input, as well as functions to make it work. I will have to watch videos on how to do this, since my chromebook was not the ideal coding tool when we were learning about it. I believe it is saved in my google docs, but learning more about it won't hurt. I am excited to write this code, even though it looks scary right now. One thing I need to work on is using lists. I had trouble making the number creator last week, so I will have to work on this tonight too.

Today, I learned about lists, and also refreshed on functions. We played a game and tried to identify the type of function it was. I worked on making a list, but struggled finding the small errors in the code. I would be missing a " in one spot, and forget to add an = sign in another spot. I ran into lots of issues today with both the practice list and my website. On the site, I am trying to link Longboarding and Cruising to the tabs, and link it back to the home page. I need to read through the code and identify what is keeping the code from working. I typed the extension into the url and the site worked, but the link does not work when I click on it. Also, when I am at the different page, I can't get back to the home page. I will work on it tonight and add a few other details like pics.

Today, I learned about strings, integers, floats, booleans, as well as python. A string is a series of numbers and letters that make up text. Integers are whole numbers, floats are real numbers, and booleans are true and false statements. When using these, we can tell the computer to remember data and display it later on. Creating variables is helpful because you can plug in data and pull it up several times. You can also do math using variables. Times is not x, it is *. 2 * is squared. I used google docs to write code using variables for a conversation. I learned that python is a low level code, which means it is very close to the hardware, rather than high level code which easier to use. A jet has high level code because if it was low level code and something went wrong, the plane would crash.

Today, I continued working on my website. I picked the name Chipped because often times skaters will chip their boards, which makes it much harder to skate. I thoght it was catchy, so I went with it. Next, I moded the regular slideshow and turned it into a cauousel slideshow. The pictures scroll by themselves, rather than having to click the arrows to see the pics. Now, I am working on making different links so that I can access different pages on the site. I wan it to be a skateboarding site for people to take pics they like and use them for their backgrounds. I am hoping to add video as well, but the pictures are #1 right now. Finally, I am going to make the site look cooler by adding different colors and pictures. I learned how to make deep colors rather than very light colors. I was only changing one number, but you need to add/remove f's and numbers. Overall, I tried making the bacic things I added fancier.

Today, I started writing my own website! Using bootstrap templates from w3schools.com, I picked a website I liked and started making changes to the code. I learned that with bootstrap, the screen layout will change to what kind of screen it is being shown on. Turns out, the website that created the bootstrap code does not use it on their own website! I didn't use the pi much, but practiced a lot with the website. We learned that css is the graphics of an html site. Without css, the page would be blank with links on it. I added pictures, as well as a slideshow to show the pictures. It helps to delete code and see what happens! This is one of the ways I learn about how code works. Taking a piston out of an engine and trying to run the car is a great way to learn how the car works! Finally, after long and careful coding, I figured out how to fix my first website called Scott's favorite shows. It took a very long time and a few breaks to finally get it the way I wanted it. After using css and bootstrap, I see how much is possible as far as graphics go. You can do much more with css.

Today, I learned how to navigate through the pi. I learned how to write scripts, and became more confident with the pi. I am becoming more comfertable with the pi, and am learning more commands. One thing I found very helpful was the auto fill in feature for code that you don't remember. You type a letter and hit tab and it fills it in. Also, learning how to connect the pi to the internet is helpful. I also learned about HTML and how to make a website! It is baciclly files that organize material. FUN STUFF! Also learned about starve.io! Great program!

Today, I learned how to work my rasberry pi. We worked on connecting the internet to the pi, as well as how to clone files. I also learned a few types of commands like ls and ping! I learned that with pi, you don't need to download any files or programs because they are all downloaded. I am hoping to learn how to further navigate the pi and create programs that can be used in my everday life. I am very happy with the course so far, and am learning a lot. Overall, I learned how to do a few bacic commands, how to clone, and how to work together and find a solution to difficult problems like setting up the wifi. Can't wait till we start getting serious and making some crazy programs that can make life easier.
