Today, I continued working on my website. I picked the name Chipped because often times skaters will chip their boards, which makes it much harder to skate. I thoght it was catchy, so I went with it. Next, I moded the regular slideshow and turned it into a cauousel slideshow. The pictures scroll by themselves, rather than having to click the arrows to see the pics. Now, I am working on making different links so that I can access different pages on the site. I wan it to be a skateboarding site for people to take pics they like and use them for their backgrounds. I am hoping to add video as well, but the pictures are #1 right now. Finally, I am going to make the site look cooler by adding different colors and pictures. I learned how to make deep colors rather than very light colors. I was only changing one number, but you need to add/remove f's and numbers. Overall, I tried making the bacic things I added fancier.

Today, I started writing my own website! Using bootstrap templates from w3schools.com, I picked a website I liked and started making changes to the code. I learned that with bootstrap, the screen layout will change to what kind of screen it is being shown on. Turns out, the website that created the bootstrap code does not use it on their own website! I didn't use the pi much, but practiced a lot with the website. We learned that css is the graphics of an html site. Without css, the page would be blank with links on it. I added pictures, as well as a slideshow to show the pictures. It helps to delete code and see what happens! This is one of the ways I learn about how code works. Taking a piston out of an engine and trying to run the car is a great way to learn how the car works! Finally, after long and careful coding, I figured out how to fix my first website called Scott's favorite shows. It took a very long time and a few breaks to finally get it the way I wanted it. After using css and bootstrap, I see how much is possible as far as graphics go. You can do much more with css.

Today, I learned how to navigate through the pi. I learned how to write scripts, and became more confident with the pi. I am becoming more comfertable with the pi, and am learning more commands. One thing I found very helpful was the auto fill in feature for code that you don't remember. You type a letter and hit tab and it fills it in. Also, learning how to connect the pi to the internet is helpful. I also learned about HTML and how to make a website! It is baciclly files that organize material. FUN STUFF! Also learned about starve.io! Great program!

Today, I learned how to work my rasberry pi. We worked on connecting the internet to the pi, as well as how to clone files. I also learned a few types of commands like ls and ping! I learned that with pi, you don't need to download any files or programs because they are all downloaded. I am hoping to learn how to further navigate the pi and create programs that can be used in my everday life. I am very happy with the course so far, and am learning a lot. Overall, I learned how to do a few bacic commands, how to clone, and how to work together and find a solution to difficult problems like setting up the wifi. Can't wait till we start getting serious and making some crazy programs that can make life easier.
