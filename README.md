Today, I worked on setting up my laptop for the project we are starting. I installed Python on my laptop, as well as Atom and Git desktop. I tried searching through the programs to get comfortable with how they work. I am struggling with this, but tonight I am going to play around with the programs. I am also struggling with figuring out the code for the Pokemon project. We are using print and input, as well as functions to make it work. I will have to watch videos on how to do this, since my chromebook was not the ideal coding tool when we were learning about it. I believe it is saved in my google docs, but learning more about it won't hurt. I am excited to write this code, even though it looks scary right now. One thing I need to work on is using lists. I had trouble making the number creator last week, so I will have to work on this tonight too.

Today, I learned about lists, and also refreshed on functions. We played a game and tried to identify the type of function it was. I worked on making a list, but struggled finding the small errors in the code. I would be missing a " in one spot, and forget to add an = sign in another spot. I ran into lots of issues today with both the practice list and my website. On the site, I am trying to link Longboarding and Cruising to the tabs, and link it back to the home page. I need to read through the code and identify what is keeping the code from working. I typed the extension into the url and the site worked, but the link does not work when I click on it. Also, when I am at the different page, I can't get back to the home page. I will work on it tonight and add a few other details like pics.

Today, I learned about strings, integers, floats, booleans, as well as python. A string is a series of numbers and letters that make up text. Integers are whole numbers, floats are real numbers, and booleans are true and false statements. When using these, we can tell the computer to remember data and display it later on. Creating variables is helpful because you can plug in data and pull it up several times. You can also do math using variables. Times is not x, it is *. 2 * is squared. I used google docs to write code using variables for a conversation. I learned that python is a low level code, which means it is very close to the hardware, rather than high level code which easier to use. A jet has high level code because if it was low level code and something went wrong, the plane would crash.

Today, I continued working on my website. I picked the name Chipped because often times skaters will chip their boards, which makes it much harder to skate. I thoght it was catchy, so I went with it. Next, I moded the regular slideshow and turned it into a cauousel slideshow. The pictures scroll by themselves, rather than having to click the arrows to see the pics. Now, I am working on making different links so that I can access different pages on the site. I wan it to be a skateboarding site for people to take pics they like and use them for their backgrounds. I am hoping to add video as well, but the pictures are #1 right now. Finally, I am going to make the site look cooler by adding different colors and pictures. I learned how to make deep colors rather than very light colors. I was only changing one number, but you need to add/remove f's and numbers. Overall, I tried making the bacic things I added fancier.

Today, I started writing my own website! Using bootstrap templates from w3schools.com, I picked a website I liked and started making changes to the code. I learned that with bootstrap, the screen layout will change to what kind of screen it is being shown on. Turns out, the website that created the bootstrap code does not use it on their own website! I didn't use the pi much, but practiced a lot with the website. We learned that css is the graphics of an html site. Without css, the page would be blank with links on it. I added pictures, as well as a slideshow to show the pictures. It helps to delete code and see what happens! This is one of the ways I learn about how code works. Taking a piston out of an engine and trying to run the car is a great way to learn how the car works! Finally, after long and careful coding, I figured out how to fix my first website called Scott's favorite shows. It took a very long time and a few breaks to finally get it the way I wanted it. After using css and bootstrap, I see how much is possible as far as graphics go. You can do much more with css.

Today, I learned how to navigate through the pi. I learned how to write scripts, and became more confident with the pi. I am becoming more comfertable with the pi, and am learning more commands. One thing I found very helpful was the auto fill in feature for code that you don't remember. You type a letter and hit tab and it fills it in. Also, learning how to connect the pi to the internet is helpful. I also learned about HTML and how to make a website! It is baciclly files that organize material. FUN STUFF! Also learned about starve.io! Great program!

Today, I learned how to work my rasberry pi. We worked on connecting the internet to the pi, as well as how to clone files. I also learned a few types of commands like ls and ping! I learned that with pi, you don't need to download any files or programs because they are all downloaded. I am hoping to learn how to further navigate the pi and create programs that can be used in my everday life. I am very happy with the course so far, and am learning a lot. Overall, I learned how to do a few bacic commands, how to clone, and how to work together and find a solution to difficult problems like setting up the wifi. Can't wait till we start getting serious and making some crazy programs that can make life easier.
